<p>My work has been published in partnership with <em>The Toronto Star</em>, The Tyee, PBS NewsHour, Mongabay, Mother Jones, NBC News, PRX, and Al Jazeera, among others.</p>

<p>Throughout my career projects I’ve led and contributed to have been recognized with a number of <a href="#" class="link text-emerald-800 decoration-wavy">awards</a>, including a National Edward R. Murrow Award in the category of Diveristy, Equity, and Inclusion for a project I funded and led called <em>Turning Points</em>.</p>

<p>I’m the current Executive Editor at the <a class="link text-emerald-800 decoration-wavy" href="https://globalreportingcentre.org">Global Reporting Centre</a> (GRC), a non-profit hub for global journalism collaboration, education, and research based at the University of British Columbia School of Journalism, Writing, and Media.</p>

<p>For the past ten years, I’ve also been instrumental in shaping, administering, and teaching the <a class="link text-emerald-800 decoration-wavy" href="https://globalreportingprogram.org">Global Reporting Program</a>, a graduate-level and interdisciplinary course at UBC that brings students together to gain experience in the field reporting on a year-long, deep-dive global investigation, and publishing with a major media partner.</p>

The result of that work was a documentary coproduced and broadcast by Al Jazeera on housing displacement and the 2024 Olympics, which was viewed by millions.</p>
